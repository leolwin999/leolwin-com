Hello Again! 👋  
I started this blog to share my experiences and knowledge, also as a way to track my own learnings and force myself to breakdown the complex topics.  
  
Being a seafarer isn’t as easy as it sounds, but I do this to pay the bills, and take care of the people I love, especially my big mama (my grandma 👵🏼) .  
  
Plus, I’m not a professional but a skid.  
  
Thanks for stopping by. Hope you find something helpful while you're here. 🤗
